please input a string:

The project shall have two components:  a multi-thread server implementation and a multi-process test client with strong
 emphasis on the design and implementation.  
Each project team’s test client is solely used to validate and improve the server reliability, quality and measure perfo
rmance.  
Server shall support a simple application (convert an arbitrary size text file from upper case to lower case and vice ve
rsa, count number of characters, words, sentences, count # of times each alphabet occurs, count # of times each word occ
urs.).  
Both client and server need to collect its own statistics and performance numbers.  
Synchronization primitives are necessary to insure the correctness of statistics/performance.$
